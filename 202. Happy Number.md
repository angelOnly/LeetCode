## 202. Happy Number

Easy

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example:** 

```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

### Java

````java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        if(n<1)
            return false;
        
        int newN = 0;
        int temp = 0;
        
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        while(n != 1 && !set.contains(n)){
            set.add(n);
            newN = 0;
            
            while(n>0){
                temp = n % 10; //个位数
                n = n / 10; //整数
                newN += temp * temp;
            }
            
            n = newN;
        }
        
        return n == 1;
    }
}
````

### Python

````python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
    
        visited=set()
        i=n
        while i not in visited or i!=1:
            i=sum([int(elem)**2 for elem in str(i)])
            if i in visited:
                return False
            if i==1:
                return True
            visited.add(i)
