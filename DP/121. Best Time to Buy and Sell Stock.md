## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Easy

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```
给定一个数组prices，里面的第i个元素就是商品第i天的价格。我们要选择某天买入，某天卖出（卖出操作肯定在买入操作之后）。求可能的最大利润。

**解决**

先买入才能卖出、卖价一定要比买入价格高才能成交就可以了。

### Java

````java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length < 2) return 0;
        int ans = 0;
        int bought = prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            bought = Math.min(bought, prices[i]);
            ans = Math.max(ans, prices[i] - bought);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
````

### python

````python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if prices is None or len(prices) < 2:
            return 0
        
        bought = prices[0]
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            bought = min(bought,prices[i])
            ans = max(ans,prices[i] - bought)
        
        return ans
