## 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

Hard

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most *two* transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

### Java

````java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        // 在每次买/卖之后的利润
        int buy1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int sell1 = 0;
        int buy2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int sell2 = 0;

        for (int curPrice : prices) {
            // 第一次买入价格，越小越好
            buy1 = Math.min(buy1, curPrice);
            // 第一次卖出后获得的利润，越大越好
            sell1 = Math.max(sell1, curPrice - buy1);
            // 用第一次交易的利润做第二次买入后获得的利润，越大越好
            buy2 = Math.max(buy2, sell1 - curPrice);
            // 第二次卖出后获得的利润，越大越好
            sell2 = Math.max(sell2, buy2 + curPrice);
        }
        return sell2; // 最终，获得最大利润
    }
}

### python

````python

    def maxProfit(self, prices):

        :type prices: List[int]

        for i in range(1, len(prices) + 1):
            b1, s1, b2, s2 = max(b1, -prices[i-1]), max(s1, b1+prices[i-1]), max(b2, s1-prices[i-1]), max(s2, b2+prices[i-1])
