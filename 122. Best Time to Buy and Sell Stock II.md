## 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Easy

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

假设有一个数组，它的第i个元素是一个给定的股票在第 i 天的价格。设计一个算法来找到最大的利润。你可以完成尽可能多的交易(多次买卖股票)。然而,你不能同时参与多个交易(你必须在再次购买前出售股票)。

**解决**

只要后一天的价格比前一天的价格高，就可以卖。

### Java

````java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length < 2) return 0;
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i=1; i< prices.length; i++){
            if(prices[i] > prices[i-1]){
                ans += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
````

### python

````python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if prices is None or len(prices) < 2:
            return 0
        
        ans = 0
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                ans += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        
        return ans
